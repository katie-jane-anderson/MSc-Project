# Gender-differences-in-ADHD---a-topic-modelling-approach

LDA and BERTopic models have been created to test hypotheses and compare and contrast themes relating to gender differences from two Reddit datasets: r/adhdwomen (female group) and r/ADHD (mixed gender group). 

# Data

Data for the r/adhdwomen dataset can be found linked to in the notebooks (available on Kaggle). Data for the r/ADHD dataset (sampled from the Kaggle link) can be found in the 'Data' folder above.

# Notebooks

There are three notebooks:
1) LDA Model (r/ADHD)
2) LDA Model (r/adhdwomen)
3) BERTopic Models (r/adhdwomen and r/ADHD)

# BERTopic Models

Models used to tune the final models and the final models themselves can be found in the 'Models' folder above. The BERTopic notebook refers to the correct model names.

All other steps necessary to run the code are detailed in the respective notebooks.
